                Comments:<br>
                I knew this already but California is fucking stacked when it comes to public schools.<br>
                9 UCs + 23 CSUs = 32 public universities. However, we do have a total of 58 counties in the state. I think we can build a few more UCs and CSUs here and there.<br>
                If you haven't read the article it's important to know the metrics for this list are based on return (future salary) on your investment (tuition price). Basically showing a pricier school won't necessarily lead to a better paying career long run.<br>
                Also, the list takes into account student loan debt per borrower and how long it takes to pay off that debt. Graduation and retention rates. The number of graduates of each college who have gone on to win Fulbright, Truman, Goldwater, Rhodes, Gates and Cambridge scholarships over the last four years. The number of undergraduates who went on to earn Ph.D's in the last three years. Finally, the number of leaders and entrepreneurs (rich and powerful) they have produced.<br>
                Yes, I definitely over simplified the article.<br>
                ‚ÄúBerkeley‚Äôs faculty has had a hand in the discovery of Vitamins E and K, the development of the atomic bomb and the creation of the flu vaccine.‚Äù I like how they have 2 really helpful things that progressed humanity and in between something that is capable of wiping out an entire city lol.<br>
                If you play with the filters, we‚Äôre the #1 public suburban school! ü§£<br>
                i can say this cus i go here but how are we ranked higher than Brown, John Hopkins, and CalTech LOLL<br>
                Forbes's list is based on bang for your buck. Basically, it's return on investment<br>
                I think this list is based off purely research grants or whatever, UC Davis gets a ton of money for research. Nevermind they're taking into account the students socioeconomic status which is a reason the UCs are ranked so high.<br>
                Cuz the people that made this are on crack<br>
                Cuz those aren‚Äôt public schools? They‚Äôre private?<br>
                no check the list for both public and private. uc davis ranks above those schools<br>
                Oh shit. That‚Äôs interesting‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a part of the problem then I just read the title ü§°<br>
                What's your argument that they should be ranked higher?<br>
                im really just going based off name brand. its well known that the schools i listed above are really prestigious and hard to get in to. dont get me wrong davis is a prestigious school as well but id be hard pressed to say that it can competeagainst ivy league level colleges in most areas.<br>
                How does being prestigious and harder to get into affect learning outcomes? Edit: To be clear, I'm not super sold on trying to argue that Davis is better than these schools, just that I feel a lot of the public opinion on "top" schools isn't really based on quantifiable factors, or conflates different factors together.<br>
                because better professors and very intelligent students would attend that school. (not saying davis people aren't intelligent because we are). ofc there's the issue with feeder schools and people who pay their way in but they probably make up like 1% of the student population so I think it's insignificant.<br>
                but like i said i go to davis so im thrilled we ranked so high against these other schools. just a little confused on why<br>
                I'm a little confused as to why you're a little confused. It's been well known for decades that the University of California is an elite system that has the prestige and academic rigor of any Ivy league college. It is why the entire system is referred to as the Public Ivies. Some of the best professors in the world teach at UC Davis, and students at Ivy leagues are no smarter than students at other schools.<br>
                I was wondering the same thing lmao<br>
                berkeley over stanford heh had a giggle<br>
                The only real argument against it being ranked so high is how many ucd students in this thread obviously can't read. Different metrics=different rankings Ask yourself what makes a school "good" and compare that to the metrics us news uses and what Forbes is using here. Consider that your entire basis for comparing school quality might be "traditionally people consider school X better than Y therefore it is." and question if that seems right.<br>
                Aggie Pride :MOO:<br>
                That list is broken lmao, Berkeley over Stanford and MIT??<br>
                Methodology might factor in social mobility outcomes and price. US News has dominated the conversation for years over which schools people think are generally good, even though it's used some pretty questionable metrics in the past (admission rate, alumni giving, polls, etc)<br>
                dont forget white student percentage<br>
                It's a bang-for-the-buck ranking. Stanford and MIT are much more expensive to attend.<br>
                They also are more generous with their grants though<br>
                Thou shall not question the list.<br>

                It's awesome, but I'm not sure why everyone's so surprised when it's the exact same order as last year.<br>
                Berkeley kids thinking about ending it all rn<br>
                I was surprised to learn that UC Davis was Berkeley's University Farm campus for its first 50 years<br>
                Yup. We are around because of them lol<br>
                It is the original University of California<br>
                I like to joke that apparently even in 1905 the Bay Area was so crowded they needed to put the ag school way the hell (in 1905 Berkeley to Davis was basically an all day trip) out here.<br>
                (in 1905 Berkeley to Davis was basically an all day trip) No it wasn't, it was about 2.5 hours by train from Oakland on SP, which ran twice daily (three trains, but one didn't stop in Davis). Part of the reason Davis won out as the location of the university farm was relative ease of access.<br>
                Why did the hell did I not look up the train, only the number one way of getting around those days lmao<br>
                Wow, good point!<br>
                Nice to see yall are actually happy with your ranking, unlike UCüÖ±Ô∏è...<br>
                I‚Äôm sorry you should really call it UC Berkeley or Cal. UCB is just not ok, we are mere mortals compared to them.<br>
                Many would agree with you but this guy didn‚Äôt... https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/hcqp6g/psa_to_uc_davis_students_from_the_berkeley/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf<br>
                How goated is the UC system that half the top ten is just UCs<br>
                what happened to UCB? they fell down hard in rank<br>
                Maybe you're thinking of a different ranking. They're ranked the same as last year by WSJ.<br>
                Well there was that fed report that just came out that UCB had over 40 instances of admitting students who didn't deserve it because their parents had money out of a total of 60 across the UC system (Davis had 0)<br>
                UCSD cant grasp the fact that they're behind us xD<br>
                It‚Äôs so dumb, we‚Äôre neck in neck in most rankings and it‚Äôs not like the minute differences in these rankings even matter<br>
                Same with the UCSB subreddit. They are all like how is Davis higher. And like ‚Äúwe all picked sb over Davis and sd for a reason‚Äù<br>
                Santa Barbara is nice, great place to live. Like LA without many of the LA problems<br>
                üòé<br>
                Yeah i'm thinking we're back.<br>

                Who was #1 for the public university ranking?<br>
                I'm 99% sure it's UCLA.<br>
                UCLA is #2. #1 is Michigan, and rightly so.<br>
                Mb, I'm illiterate<br>
                What is this ranking based on?<br>
                Pretty sure we went down Nationally. In 2020 we were 36.<br>

                I got in back when UCR had a momentary 49-50.5% admit rate. We'll likely get back to that once we're done expanding.<br>
                Holy fuck US News did UCSC fuckin dirty.<br>
                UCB students are crying rn that they‚Äôre not number one<br>
                The social mobility one really is the best one IMO. It helped me out so much going to UCR.<br>
                Same. Maybe next year.<br>
                PSA to UCR students from the Berkeley community Recently a meme was shared to our subeddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of. Please do not refer to Berkeley as "UCB." This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. Cal, Berkeley or UC Berkeley are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCB, on the other hand, is not. As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that "UCB" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley. While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name "UCB" to refer our school. Thank you. TL:DR Don't say "UCB" when referring to Berkeley.
